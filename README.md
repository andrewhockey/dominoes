# Jim's Dominoes

In a recent phone conversation, my old man casually revealed that he wrote this dominoes game on his Amiga back in 1989. I asked him to send it to me and then ported it to the web and sent him back a link to it, thinking it might be a nice surprise for him.

He was impressed enough to call me straight away but soon pointed out that there was no sound (fair cop) and that his version had *actual dominoes flying around the screen*. I told him it was a direct port of his original AmigaBASIC version but I don't think he bought it somehow.

We chatted about the code a little and I tried to draw his attention to where I emulated his use of GOTO by using higher-order functions but I don't think he appreciated (or understood) the subtlety of my solution. Jim came up with punched cards on the IBM System/360 and saw out his career on COBOL. "GOTO" is clearly a trigger-word for him as he launched into a rant about how They banned GOTO back in the day but, *when you really think about it*, a "for" loop is really a GOTO and a "PERFORM" is really a GOTO and I could tell that 1980's Jim had laboured this topic in great detail and on numerous occasions. Such a nerd.

Thanks for the diversion Jim.
